# Decsion making app based on AHP

It is simple mobile app, where you can define decision problem and solve it with AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process).
From this repo you can get frontend clinet written in react native and expo. Backend server is written in spring boot and you can find it [here](https://github.com/PiotrKedra/adhoc-backend).
To mention this project was created as my engineering thesis.

# How to run


# About the app

To use the app, first you have to register as a new user and then login with your credential. 
In the main menu you can define new problem, see history of your problems and take part in the decision problem that other users shared to you.

When you want to create new problem first you have to define objectives, then criteria. After the definition you will have to go through the pairwise comparison. In the end you can choose either to immediately go to the result or you can share the problem with other users, giving their emails. If you do so, you can check your ranking by going to 'Your problems'. You will see current ranking and information about other user. If other user provides the data the ranking will update.
